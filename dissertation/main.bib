Our work seeks to address the lack of out-of-the-box support for signed languages in current MT systems and is based on the SignBank dataset, which contains pairs of spoken language text and SignWriting content. We introduce novel methods to parse, factorize, decode, and evaluate SignWriting, leveraging ideas from neural factored MT. In a bilingual setup{---}translating from American Sign Language to (American) English{---}our method achieves over 30 BLEU, while in two multilingual setups{---}translating in both directions between spoken languages and signed languages{---}we achieve over 20 BLEU. We find that common MT techniques used to improve spoken language translation similarly affect the performance of sign language translation. These findings validate our use of an intermediate text representation for signed languages to include them in natural language processing research.",

Due to the relative lack of research efforts in this area, the facial capabilities of such avatars have yet to receive the approval of those in the Deaf community. This paper revisits the representations of the human face in signed avatars, specifically those based on parameterized muscle simulation such as FACS and the MPEG-4 file definition. An improved framework based on rotational pivots and pre-defined movements is capable of reproducing realistic, natural gestures and mouthings on sign language avatars. The new approach is more harmonious with the underlying construction of signed avatars, generates improved results, and allows for a more intuitive workflow for the artists and animators who interact with the system.",

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the problem of lip-syncing a talking face video of an arbitrary identity to match a target speech segment. Current works excel at producing accurate lip movements on a static image or videos of specific people seen during the training phase. However, they fail to accurately morph the lip movements of arbitrary identities in dynamic, unconstrained talking face videos, resulting in significant parts of the video being out-of-sync with the new audio. We identify key reasons pertaining to this and hence resolve them by learning from a powerful lip-sync discriminator. Next, we propose new, rigorous evaluation benchmarks and metrics to accurately measure lip synchronization in unconstrained videos. Extensive quantitative evaluations on our challenging benchmarks show that the lip-sync accuracy of the videos generated by our Wav2Lip model is almost as good as real synced videos. We provide a demo video clearly showing the substantial impact of our Wav2Lip model, and also publicly release the code, models, and evaluation benchmarks on our website.},

abstract = {People talk with diversified styles. For one piece of speech, different talking styles exhibit significant differences in the facial and head pose movements. For example, the "excited" style usually talks with the mouth wide open, while the "solemn" style is more standardized and seldomly exhibits exaggerated motions. Due to such huge differences between different styles, it is necessary to incorporate the talking style into audio-driven talking face synthesis framework. In this paper, we propose to inject style into the talking face synthesis framework through imitating arbitrary talking style of the particular reference video. Specifically, we systematically investigate talking styles with our collected Ted-HD dataset and construct style codes as several statistics of 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameters. Afterwards, we devise a latent-style-fusion (LSF) model to synthesize stylized talking faces by imitating talking styles from the style codes. We emphasize the following novel characteristics of our framework: (1) It doesn't require any annotation of the style, the talking style is learned in an unsupervised manner from talking videos in the wild. (2) It can imitate arbitrary styles from arbitrary videos, and the style codes can also be interpolated to generate new styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework has the ability to synthesize more natural and expressive talking styles compared with baseline methods.},

abstract = {Real-time control of three-dimensional avatars is an important problem in the context of computer games and virtual environments. Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion.},

abstract = {We present a deep learning-based framework to synthesize motion in-betweening in a two-stage manner. Given some context frames and a target frame, the system can generate plausible transitions with variable lengths in a non-autoregressive fashion. The framework consists of two Transformer Encoder-based networks operating in two stages: in the first stage a Context Transformer is designed to generate rough transitions based on the context and in the second stage a Detail Transformer is employed to refine motion details. Compared to existing Transformer-based methods which either use a complete Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture or additional 1D convolutions to generate motion transitions, our framework achieves superior performance with less trainable parameters by only leveraging the Transformer Encoder and masked self-attention mechanism. To enhance the generalization of our transformer-based framework, we further introduce Keyframe Positional Encoding and Learned Relative Positional Encoding to make our method robust in synthesizing longer transitions exceeding the maximum transition length during training. Our framework is also artist-friendly by supporting full and partial pose constraints within the transition, giving artists fine control over the synthesized results. We benchmark our framework on the LAFAN1 dataset, and experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at a large margin (an average of 16\% for normal-length sequences and 55\% for excessive-length sequences). Our method trains faster than the RNN-based method and achieves a four-time speedup during inference. We implement our framework into a production-ready tool inside an animation authoring software and conduct a pilot study to validate the practical value of our method.},

As a result, artists spend a tremendous amount of time posing and setting more keyframes. In this pose-centric workflow, animators use combinations of forward and inverse kinematics. While forward kinematics leads to intuitive interpolations, it does not naturally support positional constraints such as fixed contact points. Inverse kinematics can be used to fix certain points in space at keyframes, but can lead to inferior interpolations, is slow to compute, and does not allow for positional contraints at non-keyframe frames. In this paper, we address these problems by formulating the control of interpolations with positional constraints over time as a space-time optimization problem in the tangent space of the animation curves driving the controls. Our method has the key properties that it (1) allows the manipulation of positions and orientations over time, extending inverse kinematics, (2) does not add new keyframes that might conflict with an artist's preferred keyframe style, and (3) works in the space of artist editable animation curves and hence integrates seamlessly with current pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of the technique in practice via various examples and use cases.},

abstract = {Generating realistic Sign Language using signing avatars is a challenging task that typically involves synthesis using either procedural or pre-animated techniques like motion capture or artistic editing of signs. However, combining these two approaches is difficult. In this work, we propose a novel method for generating intermediate poses in a multi-track representation of a sign language discourse. The proposed method uses procedural generation with artistic techniques to prioritize certain aspects of the generated poses while sacrificing others to improve the overall consistency of the representation. The system is implemented as an add-on in Blender, an open-source 3D toolkit.},

abstract = {The challenge of simulating realistic Sign Language using avatars lies in achieving accurate human-like postures for effective communication. Unlike artistic or motion capture techniques, linguist-driven procedural generation methods are widely employed, relying on skeletal representations to synthesize a broad range of signs. However, determining appropriate joint limits for these avatars is intricate due to inter-joint and intra-joint dependencies, as well as variations in biomechanical properties. In this context, our work addresses this problem by introducing a pose corrector, enhancing an established Sign Language synthesis technique. Focused on rectifying extreme joint rotations, our approach incorporates a pre-trained poser based on existing work, integrated with a 21-joint character model. The correction process involves applying linguist-defined constraints using AZee language and subsequent pose corrections, showcasing promising advancements in obtaining more natural sign gestures.},

abstract = {We present a real-time character control mechanism using a novel neural network architecture called a Phase-Functioned Neural Network. In this network structure, the weights are computed via a cyclic function which uses the phase as an input. Along with the phase, our system takes as input user controls, the previous state of the character, the geometry of the scene, and automatically produces high quality motions that achieve the desired user control. The entire network is trained in an end-to-end fashion on a large dataset composed of locomotion such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing movements fitted into virtual environments. Our system can therefore automatically produce motions where the character adapts to different geometric environments such as walking and running over rough terrain, climbing over large rocks, jumping over obstacles, and crouching under low ceilings. Our network architecture produces higher quality results than time-series autoregressive models such as LSTMs as it deals explicitly with the latent variable of motion relating to the phase. Once trained, our system is also extremely fast and compact, requiring only milliseconds of execution time and a few megabytes of memory, even when trained on gigabytes of motion data. Our work is most appropriate for controlling characters in interactive scenes such as computer games and virtual reality systems.},
