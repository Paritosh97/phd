abstract = {Generating realistic Sign Language using signing avatars is a challenging task that typically involves synthesis using either procedural or pre-animated techniques like motion capture or artistic editing of signs. However, combining these two approaches is difficult. In this work, we propose a novel method for generating intermediate poses in a multi-track representation of a sign language discourse. The proposed method uses procedural generation with artistic techniques to prioritize certain aspects of the generated poses while sacrificing others to improve the overall consistency of the representation. The system is implemented as an add-on in Blender, an open-source 3D toolkit.},

abstract = {The challenge of simulating realistic Sign Language using avatars lies in achieving accurate human-like postures for effective communication. Unlike artistic or motion capture techniques, linguist-driven procedural generation methods are widely employed, relying on skeletal representations to synthesize a broad range of signs. However, determining appropriate joint limits for these avatars is intricate due to inter-joint and intra-joint dependencies, as well as variations in biomechanical properties. In this context, our work addresses this problem by introducing a pose corrector, enhancing an established Sign Language synthesis technique. Focused on rectifying extreme joint rotations, our approach incorporates a pre-trained poser based on existing work, integrated with a 21-joint character model. The correction process involves applying linguist-defined constraints using AZee language and subsequent pose corrections, showcasing promising advancements in obtaining more natural sign gestures.},
