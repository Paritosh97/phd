Cover page: I think that the term ‘animation‘ is missing in the English title of the manuscript, but seeing
that the English title differs from the one I received in the official document this might simply be an error
(I think the title ‘Sign Language synthesis from AZee expressions with an animation system of decreasing
granularity’ is more informative)
P25: The title of Section 2.1.2 stands alone at the bottom of the page
P26: there are 3 occurrences of “An Score”. I assume “A Score” would be more appropriate (unless not
pronounced like the word score). I was actually not sure what Score meant in this context, as it seems
more like a description than a metric (I suppose it is reminiscent of scores in music, but still think that a
formal definition would benefit the reader).
P27: a recrusive -> a recursive
P31: in in SL synthesis
P32: “rig(add” -> “rig (add”
P41/43: limitations of IK methods are presented in Figure 2.28, however this figure is difficult to
understand given that it is not detailed in text (p41 only mentions that classical IK techniques struggle
with a number of situations). I think the manuscript would benefit from a short paragraph describing
these limitations, and linking them to Figure 2.28.
P42/43: Figures 2.26, 2.27, 2.28 too small and difficult to read
P48: “animations(figure” -> “animations (figure”
P62: lingusit -> linguist
P63: crate -> create
P63: “Figure 2.53 visualizes this flattening process shows the flattened version of …” -> strange sentence
(two verbs)
P63: heirarchy -> hierarchy
P64: for each of the frame -> for each of the frames
P65: sentence starting with “Even though this approach allows a better coverage” -> strange sentence,
might be missing a clause (sentence does not seem to be finished)
P70: didn’t -> did not (formal)
P76: “hands(a change” -> “hands (a change” / “eyebrows(a change” -> “eyebrows (a change”
P78: “Top optimize” -> “To optimize”?
P80 (Figure 3.12): inter-subjecitivty -> inter-subjectivity
P81: “The newer system demonstrates improved constraint satisfaction” -> the paragraph should be
reporting the actual values then, for transparency.
P142: “using pose estimation techniques 6” -> not sure what the 6 is (Figure ?)
P 144 (Figure 4), this figure is too small and impossible to read, consider breaking down into small
separate figures?
Figures 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9: these figures are difficult to read (text is too small, and it is therefore
difficult to understand what the different blocks correspond to)
Figure 4.6: this figure appears before figure 4.3
Figures 5.2 & 5.3: these figures are too small to read
P 104: inights -> insights
Table 5.2: the poses are difficult to compare given that they are not seen from the same angle
P 106: capturing thte nuances -> capturing the nuances
P 106: “Similarly, while the integration of pose correction into SL synthesis in out animator, it also
introduces new challenges.” -> sentence seems to be missing a verb
P 107: “alternative A.6” -> “alternative (see Appendix A.6)” ?
P 107: “could be studied further improving the the learnt pose prior” -> “could be studied further to
improve the learnt pose prior”
P 110: “A few action units were not added 6.2 since” -> not sure what the 6.2 is for (Figure or Section ?)
Figure 6.3: the differences in AY are extremely difficult to perceive (especially as the last one also has
variations in color). It might help the reader to mention what the different AUs (or blendshapes) are for
each image, to know what differences to expect.
P 122: previosu -> previous
P 122: “Chapter 6 presents integration of facial expressions in The chapter” -> missing part of the
sentence, before ‘The chapter’
P 124: doesn’t -> does not (formal)
P 124: “Thus. while a common space” -> replace ‘.’ by ‘,’ (or missing part of the sentence?)
